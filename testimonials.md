  <blockquote>“Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – technologists had to manually restrain my daughter during the procedure.Therefore, I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technologist used The Q. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent.”</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"My daughter was so happy you let me stay in the room during the procedure. My daughter stayed focused on me and the Q holder and less on the room and scary machines.”</blockquote>

  <blockquote>“My son was wiggling too much to allow the technologist to get good ultrasound pictures. After we put on the foam holder, the technologist was able to get clearer pictures.”</blockquote>
