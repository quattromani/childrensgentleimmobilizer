- The contoured ergonomic design is a pure positioning innovation.
- Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities without over-handling.
- Contours to the child rather than forcing the child to fit the positioner.
- Minimizes pressure points with a ½ inch thick comfortable foam.
- Does not interferer with tubes, lines and catheters.
