# **INTRODUCTION TO THE PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER**
To successfully perform brief minor medical procedures on infants and children, such as laceration repair, removal of foreign bodies from the ears or nose, and radiological examinations like chest x-rays and VCUGs, it is essential for the child to remain relatively still. This can be achieved through non-pharmacological methods such as distraction, effective communication, coping techniques (e.g., deep breathing, blowing bubbles, holding a caregiver's hand), audiovisual aids, and physical holding.

Current methods of physical holding include the use of the papoose board, "burrito wrapping," and "brute force" direct hands-on restraint. By restraint we mean ‘using physical force without the child’s consent’. Restraint can be devastating, increasing the child's apprehension and potentially inducing post-traumatic stress. It should only be used in emergency situations when no alternatives are available.

Restraint and immobilization of children are significant issues for healthcare professionals who care for infants and children today. A better, non-aggressive mode of immobilization is needed for the psychological benefit of both the child and the parent.

The way we hold children for procedures reflects our values as a culture. 

# **HOW PEDIATRIC CARE HAS TRANSFORMED:**
## **EVOLUTION OVER THE YEARS**
In my 50 years of practice, I have observed various methods used to keep children still during medical procedures, particularly in radiology. Traditionally, we have relied on manual restraint, often referred to as "Brute Force," where medical staff physically hold the child in place. This method, while effective in preventing movement, can cause significant anxiety and fear in young patients.

Mechanical devices such as the papoose board, Pigg-O-Stat, and the “Burrito wrap” have been commonly used. These devices secure the child with straps and boards, which can be uncomfortable and intimidating for children. A method frequently employed in emergency rooms is the "Burrito hold," where the child is wrapped tightly in a sheet or blanket to restrict movement.

# **INTRODUCING THE PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER**
Safety and customer care are of the foremost concerns in pediatric medical care, encompassing the well-being of the child, the parent or caregiver, and the healthcare provider. The Pediatric Position Holder (PPH) addresses a critical need in pediatric care by offering a standardized, gentle, and safe solution for pediatric medical positioning. 

Hospitals and insurance companies place immense value on safety as it directly impacts patient outcomes, hospital ratings, and financial relationships. The PPH ensures that millions of everyday procedures, performed annually, are safer for all involved. 

By reducing the need for manual restraint and minimizing the risk of bruising or injury, The Holder enhances the safety of medical procedures. The device's design respects the autonomy of young patients, reduces their distress, and ensures a more controlled and calm experience during medical interventions.

The inspiration behind the PPH is rooted in the urgent need for a safe, standardized solution for pediatric medical positioning, guided by the four fundamental principles of biomedical ethics as articulated by Beauchamp and Childress (2013):

**Autonomy:** The PPH respects the autonomy of young patients by reducing the need for physical restraint, allowing children to experience less distress and feel more in control during medical procedures.

**Non-maleficence:** By minimizing the need for manual restraint and reducing the likelihood of bruising or injury, the PPH adheres to the principle of non-maleficence, ensuring that no harm comes to the patient.

**Beneficence:** The PPH provides clear benefits by improving procedural accuracy and efficiency, reducing the need for repeat procedures, and enhancing overall patient care.

**Justice:** The PPH promotes justice by offering a standardized method of patient care that can be applied fairly across different medical settings, ensuring that all children worldwide receive high-quality care.

The PPH is versatile and can be used across various medical settings, including radiology, emergency rooms, and minor procedure units. Its design ensures that children remain comfortable, secure, and safe during procedures, helping to alleviate the anxiety and stress often associated with medical interventions. The PPH’s non-threatening appearance, featuring soft materials, can be enhanced with familiar concepts and/or decorative elements, providing children an opportunity to familiarize themselves with it ahead of the procedure. This pre-exposure to the holder can reduce the stress of introducing a foreign object immediately before a medical procedure, enhancing the child's comfort and cooperation. For children with chronic illnesses who undergo repeat procedures, this familiarity can significantly add to their comfort, making each procedure less daunting and more manageable.

# WHY THIS DESIGN?

## **THE PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER addresses several issues:**
- **Improves Workflow:** The device simplifies the process of securing children during medical procedures, reducing the time and effort required by medical staff.
- **Raises the Standard of Care:** By providing a comfortable and secure method of immobilization, the holder reduces the stress and anxiety experienced by young patients, thereby improving the overall quality of care.

## **KEEPING A CHILD STILL DURING RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES, IV STICKS, AND SIMILAR MEDICAL TASKS IS CRUCIAL FOR SEVERAL REASONS:**
1. **Accuracy of Results**: For imaging procedures like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, even small movements can blur the images or produce artifacts. Clear and accurate images are essential for diagnosing and assessing medical conditions correctly.
1. **Reduced Need for Repeat Procedures**: If a child moves during a procedure, the images may be unusable, necessitating retakes. This not only increases the time the child has to spend in the medical setting but also exposes them to additional radiation or discomfort.
1. **Decreased Procedure Time**: When a child remains still, the procedure can be completed more quickly, minimizing the child's exposure to the environment and reducing the overall stress and discomfort.
1. **Minimized Discomfort**: For procedures like IV insertion, movement can lead to multiple attempts or difficulty in placing the needle properly. Keeping the child still can help ensure that the procedure is done accurately and with less pain.
1. **Safety**: In some cases, movement can lead to accidental injuries, especially with equipment used in radiology or during invasive procedures. Staying still helps prevent accidents and ensures the safety of the child.
1. **Enhanced Communication and Cooperation**: Teaching and encouraging a child to stay still helps them develop an understanding of medical procedures and fosters better communication with healthcare providers, which can be beneficial for future medical visits.

# **PARENT TESTIMONIALS**

# **Handling Without Holding: The Role of the Pediatric Position Holder in the Absence of Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS)**
Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) are educated and clinically trained in understanding the developmental impact of illness and injury. They play a crucial role in improving patient and family care, satisfaction, and overall experience. In healthcare and community settings, CCLS help infants, children, youth, and families cope with the stress and uncertainty of acute and chronic illness, injury, trauma, disability, loss, and bereavement. They provide evidence-based, developmentally and psychologically appropriate interventions, including therapeutic play, preparation for procedures, and education to reduce fear, anxiety, apprehension, and pain.
## **The Vital Role of CCLS**
Child life specialists use various techniques to support children through difficult procedures:

The availability of CCLS is not consistent, especially in smaller clinics or hospitals. Many countries do not have CCLS, and there are millions of procedural events annually worldwide where help with immobilization and support for suturing, nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and other minor procedures is required. In the absence of a CCLS, what are the mechanical options for holding the child motionless?
## **The Pediatric Position Holder (PPH) as a Middle Ground**
The Pediatric Position Holder is a middle-ground between the preferred methods of the CCLS and the invasive methods currently in use. The Pediatric Position Holder (PPH) offers an optimal solution. It provides a gentle and minimally invasive alternative to traditional restraint methods, ensuring that children are positioned securely and comfortably without the need for direct physical holding.

## **Advantages of the PPH:**
- **Radiolucent for x-ray imaging**
- **Standardizes procedures worldwide**
- **Colorful and engaging design to distract children**
- **Less invasive and not restrictive**
- **Selective in application**
- **Adheres to the principle of justice by providing equal care standards globally**

# **THE	PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER IS A STANDALONE DEVICE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OR ACCESSORIES.**
The Pediatric Position Holder (PPH) is designed to be used under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional, ensuring proper application and patient safety. While it is primarily a professional product, its simplicity and safety features could make it suitable for over-the-counter retail in the future.
## **THE PPH could be offered in either or both of the following options:**
- **Single Use:** Single patient, disposable
- **Durable:** Multiple uses, multiple patients

## **THE PPH is available in both sterile and non-sterile options:**
- **Sterile:** For single patient use
- **Non-Sterile:** For multiple patients, the durable holder simply needs to be cleaned between uses with an approved antimicrobial spray, which most facilities and medical offices already use. This process takes only seconds and allows the holder to dry quickly.
