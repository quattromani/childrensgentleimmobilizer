- The Q Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new child friendly, single patient use immobilizer which is effective, safe, simple and versatile.
- The Q Position Holder is an emerging medical technology for children that standardizes the process of immobilization for medical procedures.
- Our 1/2" thick, soft polyurethane foam holder has no extraneous straps, boards, or hook & loop attachments.
- Our hope is that we can lessen the anxiety, fear, and distress which are ways that children respond to medical procedures.<sup>[1]</sup>
- The Q Holder is used only for short periods in highly monitored settings.
- The Q leaves the chest and abdomen free for unrestricted breathing.
- No other position holder leaves the chest, abdomen and pelvis free for unrestricted respirations as well as uninterrupted tube and line placement.

## Most pediatric medical procedures are better performed when the child is motionless

## Why we call it The Q

The Q Pediatric Position Holder was created by Dr. Frank Quattromani (a.k.a. “Dr. Q”), a board certified pediatric radiologist.

## Currently: 
- up until now there has been no uniform standard agreement on how children should be temporarily held immobile for various medical procedures.
- today it is commonplace to tie-down, tape down, or physically hold down.

| When fully deployed, the Q holder leaves the chest and abdomen free for unrestricted respirations |

<br>

| ![Securing the NEck, Head, and Arms - Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/my-first-new-years.jpg) |

| The Q positioner maximizes contact, minimizes movement allowing for sufficient immobilization without unnecessary hands-on. |

## Design

- Designed with field-testing for maximum usability.
- Designed to be compatible with all major commercial imaging systems.
- Designed so as not to confine.
- The design keeps the arms and legs away form the chest and abdomen leaving the chest "open" for better respirations.
- The contoured ergonomic design is a pure positioning innovation.
- Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities without over-handling.
- Contours to the child rather than forcing the child to fit the positioner.
- Reduces excessive motion.
- Minimizes pressure points with a thick comfortable foam.
- Does not interferer with tubes, lines and catheters.
- The Q supports the head and neck as a unit.
- Designed for a more comfortable hold.
- Can be warmed in a towel warmer prior to use.

## The Q is simple while allowing a variety of holds

## Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS)

- Child Life Specialists focus on the psychosocial aspect of the child providing coping mechanisms for procedures.
- Coping skills minimize the adverse effects on the child and parent.
- The CCLS uses a family centered approach.
- The Q is intended to compliemnts the work of the CCLS.
- The CCLS can incorporate the Q as one of the "comfort kit" tools by using it for medical play.

## Radiation reduction

The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within the pediatric radiology community. The Q assists children to remain montionless for diagnostic X-Rays, thus fewer exposures could mean less radiation. 

The Q allows the radiologic technologists to remain further from the primary and scatter radiation.

## Parents are positive about The Q

| ![Mother & Child - Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/IMG_1970.jpg) |

> “Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – technologists had to manually restrain my daughter during the procedure.Therefore, I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technologist used The Q Pediatric Position Holder. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent.”

~	Mom of 6 month old infant, Lubbock, TX

| ![Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/IMG_1672.jpg) | 

> “My daughter was so happy you let me stay in the room during the procedure. My daughter stayed focused on me and the Q holder and less on the room and scary machines.”

~	Dad of 2 year old from Clovis, NM


The Q is for single-patient use only to ensure compliance with infection prevention requirements and protocols.

> “My son was wiggling too much to allow the technologist to get good ultrasound pictures. After we applied the foam holder, the technologist was able to get clearer pictures.”
