# THE Q PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER:
## A Child-Friendly Innovation

![The Q Pediatric Position Holder](images/IMG_1740.JPG)

**The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder** is an innovative, child-friendly device designed for single-patient use. It is effective, safe, simple, and versatile, providing a standardized method for securely positioning children during medical procedures. Made from 1/2” thick, soft polyurethane foam, it features no extraneous straps, boards, or hook-and-loop attachments, ensuring comfort and ease of use.

Our aim is to reduce the anxiety, fear, and distress that children often experience during medical procedures. The Q Holder is used for short periods in highly monitored settings, offering the unique advantage of **leaving the chest, abdomen, and pelvis free for unrestricted respiration and uninterrupted tube and line placement**.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Child-Friendly Design:** Reduces stress and improves the experience for both children and healthcare providers.
- **Comfort and Safety:** Soft foam construction with no harsh attachments.
- **Effective and Versatile:** Suitable for various medical procedures, ensuring consistent and gentle care.
- **Enhanced Procedure Quality:** Allows for better positioning and access without compromising respiratory or tube placements.

**Most pediatric medical procedures are better performed when the child is motionless**

# HOW PEDIATRIC CARE HAS TRANSFORMED:
## Evolution Over The Years
Medical procedures for children have evolved significantly over the years. In the past, various methods were used to restrain children, often causing distress. **Today, the focus is on gentle, child-friendly techniques**. Let's explore some of the historical methods to appreciate how far pediatric care has come.

Historically, devices like the papoose board and Pigg-O-Stat were used to keep children still during procedures. Manual restraint, where medical staff physically held the child, was also common. These methods, while effective, often resulted in anxiety and fear for young patients. Modern positioning aids, like the Q Pediatric Position Holder, are designed to ensure both security and comfort, making medical procedures less stressful for children and caregivers.

# HOW THE Q POSITIONER TRANSFORMS PEDIATRIC CARE:
## Maximizes Contact, Minimizes Movement

The Q Positioner ensures optimal contact and minimal movement, providing effective stabilization without the need for excessive hands-on intervention. This innovative design allows for sufficient stabilization, ensuring procedures are performed safely and efficiently while maintaining the child's comfort and reducing stress.

## Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS)
- Holistic Child Support: Child Life Specialists focus on the psychosocial well-being of children, providing essential coping mechanisms to navigate medical procedures with confidence and calm.
- Minimizing Adverse Effects: By employing effective coping skills, they help to significantly reduce the stress and anxiety experienced by both the child and their parents.
- Complementary to CCLS Efforts: The Q Pediatric Position Holder is designed to seamlessly integrate with the efforts of CCLS, enhancing their work by offering a gentle, secure, and comforting method of positioning.
- Versatile Comfort Tool: Recognized as a valuable addition to the "comfort kit," the Q can be used during medical play to familiarize children with medical procedures in a non-threatening and playful manner, promoting a positive experience.

## RADIATION REDUCTION
**(REDUCCIÓN DE LA RADIACIÓN)**

Reducing radiation exposure is a critical concern in pediatric radiology. The Q Pediatric Position Holder assists with precise positioning for diagnostic X-rays, potentially reducing the number of exposures and thereby minimizing radiation.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Safety for Technologists:** Allows radiologic technologists to maintain a safer distance from primary and scatter radiation.
- **Child-Friendly Design:** Effective, safe, simple, and versatile for single-patient use.
- **Comfort:** Made from 1/2” thick, soft polyurethane foam without extraneous straps or boards, reducing anxiety, fear, and distress.
- **Free Respiration:** Ensures the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remain free for unrestricted breathing and uninterrupted tube and line placement.

The Q Holder is designed for short-term use in highly monitored settings, enhancing both safety and comfort during medical procedures.

## Why This Design?
Our positioner allows us to "hold without handling." The methodology behind The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder places the child in a warm, cushioned, and open device during medical procedures, providing both comfort and accessibility. Designed to ensure lines, tubes, and catheters are easily accessible, our open device allows the chest and abdomen, or the entire torso, to remain unrestrained for better respiration.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Gentle Support:** The open design offers gentle yet effective support, reducing the need for physical restraint and minimizing stress for the child.
- **Improved Respiration:** By keeping the chest and abdomen free, the positioner allows for unobstructed breathing, enhancing comfort and safety during procedures.
- **Easy Access:** Ideal for procedures requiring access to the perineum and pelvis, such as voiding cysto-urethrogram studies and contrast colon studies, ensuring medical professionals can work efficiently without compromising the child's comfort.
