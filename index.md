# THE Q PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER:
## A Child-Friendly Innovation

![The Q Pediatric Position Holder](images/IMG_1740.JPG)

**The Q Pediatric Position Holder** is an innovative, child-friendly device designed for single-patient use. It is effective, safe, simple, and versatile, providing a standardized method for securely positioning children during medical procedures. Made from 1/2” thick, soft polyurethane foam, it features no extraneous straps, boards, or hook-and-loop attachments, ensuring comfort and ease of use.

Our aim is to reduce the anxiety, fear, and distress that children often experience during medical procedures. The Q Holder is used for short periods in highly monitored settings, offering the unique advantage of **leaving the chest, abdomen, and pelvis free for unrestricted respiration and uninterrupted tube and line placement**.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Child-Friendly Design:** Reduces stress and improves the experience for both children and healthcare providers.
- **Comfort and Safety:** Soft foam construction with no harsh attachments.
- **Effective and Versatile:** Suitable for various medical procedures, ensuring consistent and gentle care.
- **Enhanced Procedure Quality:** Allows for better positioning and access without compromising respiratory or tube placements.

## Most pediatric medical procedures are better performed when the child is motionless

### HOW PEDIATRIC CARE HAS TRANSFORMED:
### Evolution Over The Years

Medical procedures for children have evolved significantly over the years. In the past, various methods were used to restrain children, often causing distress. **Today, the focus is on gentle, child-friendly techniques**. Let's explore some of the historical methods to appreciate how far pediatric care has come.

Historically, devices like the papoose board and Pigg-O-Stat were used to keep children still during procedures. Manual restraint, where medical staff physically held the child, was also common. These methods, while effective, often resulted in anxiety and fear for young patients. Modern positioning aids, like the Q Pediatric Position Holder, are designed to ensure both security and comfort, making medical procedures less stressful for children and caregivers.

## The Q positioner maximizes contact, minimizes movement allowing for sufficient stabilization without unnecessary hands-on

## CERTIFIED CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS (CCLS)
- Child Life Specialists focus on the psychosocial aspect of the child providing coping mechanisms for procedures.
- Coping skills minimize the adverse effects on the child and parent.
- The Q is intended to complement the work of the CCLS.
- The CCLS can incorporate the Q as one of the “comfort kit” tools by using it for medical play.

## RADIATION REDUCTION
**(REDUCCIÓN DE LA RADIACIÓN)**

Reducing radiation exposure is a critical concern in pediatric radiology. The Q Pediatric Position Holder assists with precise positioning for diagnostic X-rays, potentially reducing the number of exposures and thereby minimizing radiation.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Safety for Technologists:** Allows radiologic technologists to maintain a safer distance from primary and scatter radiation.
- **Child-Friendly Design:** Effective, safe, simple, and versatile for single-patient use.
- **Comfort:** Made from 1/2” thick, soft polyurethane foam without extraneous straps or boards, reducing anxiety, fear, and distress.
- **Free Respiration:** Ensures the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remain free for unrestricted breathing and uninterrupted tube and line placement.

The Q Holder is designed for short-term use in highly monitored settings, enhancing both safety and comfort during medical procedures.
