title: The "Q"
---

The Q Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new pediatric child friendly, single patient use immobilizer which is effective, safe, simple and versatile. The Q Position Holder is a new emerging medical technology for children that standardizes the process of immobilization. The Q holder offers consistency across all modes of care for the infant and child. Our 1/2" thick, soft polyester foam holder has no extraneous straps, boards, or hook & loop attachments. Our hope is that we can lessen the anxiety, fear, and distress which are ways that children respond essentially, there is no tie down, tape or hold down during imaging and other medical procedures.<sup>[1]</sup>

Currently, there is no uniform standard agreement on how children should be temporarily held immobile for various medical procedures. Instead, there are a variety of solutions and methods for holding a child motionless during a medical procedure, including blankets, sheets, "burrito-ing", pillowcases, towels, medical tape, ace bandages, manual physical force and procedural sedation.

Unfortunately, current solutions and methods are used inconsistently and can often be ineffective and difficult to implement. The Q Holder ends the practice of physically overpowering the child to gain control and render the child motionless. The Pediatric Position Holder is used in a highly monitored setting under the care of a certified health care provider and is removed immediately after the procedure. The holding time is limited in duration to support a specific position and is not considered restraint intervention by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

## Why we call it The Q

The Q Pediatric Position Holder was created by Dr. Frank Quattromani (a.k.a. “Dr. Q”), a board certified pediatric radiologist.

The Q is for single-patient use only to ensure compliance with infection prevention requirements and protocols.

## Design

The design keeps the arms and legs away form the chest and abdomen leaving the chest "open" for better respirations.

![Chest and abdomen free for respirations - Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/IMG_1778-min_832x.jpg)

Our positioner allows us to "hold without handling.” The methodology designed into The Q pediatric position holder places the child in a warm, cushioned and open design for medical procedures where the lines, tubes, and catheters are easily accessible. Our “Open design” is intended to allow the chest and abdomen or entire torso to remain unrestrained allowing for better respiration. The Q is intended to compliment and not replace the child life specialist.

## The ergonomic features

The new contoured ergonomic design is a pure positioning innovation which:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Contours to the child's body rather than the child being forced to conform to the immobilizer.</li>
  <li>Reduces excessive motion.</li>
  <li>Minimizes pressure points on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Provides for clearance of tubes and lines.</li>
  <li>Firmly contours to support the head and neck as a unit.</li>
</ol>

## Radiation reduction

The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within pediatric radiology and is an exceptional benefit provided by The Q Holder.

The Q Pediatric Position Holder is designed for children weighing up to approx. 30 lbs.

The Q assists children to remain montionless for diagnostic X-Rays, thus fewer exposures could mean less radiation. The Q allows the radiologic technologists to remain further from the primary and scatter radiation.

## Parents are positive about The Q

![Mother & Child - Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/IMG_1970.jpg)

> “Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – the technician had to manually restrain my daughter during the procedure and it was very upsetting to watch. My baby hated it. I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technologist used The Q Pediatric Position Holder. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent. It made the procedure easier for everyone!”

~	Mom of 6 month old infant, Lubbock, TX
