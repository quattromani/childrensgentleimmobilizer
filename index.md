title: The "Q"
---

The Q Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new pediatric child friendly, single patient use immobilizer which is effective, safe, simple and versatile. The Q Position Holder is a new emerging medical technology for children that standardizes the process of immobilization. The Q holder offers consistency across all modes of care for the infant and child. Our 1/2" thick, soft polyester foam holder has no extraneous straps, boards, or hook & loop attachments. Our hope is that we can lessen the anxiety, fear, and distress which are ways that children respond to medical procedures.<sup>[1]</sup>

## Why we call it The Q

The Q Pediatric Position Holder was created by Dr. Frank Quattromani (a.k.a. “Dr. Q”), a board certified pediatric radiologist.

Currently, there is no uniform standard agreement on how children should be temporarily held immobile for various medical procedures. Instead, there are a variety of solutions and methods for holding a child motionless during a medical procedure, including blankets, sheets, "burrito-ing", pillowcases, towels, medical tape, ace bandages, manual physical force and procedural sedation.

Today it is commonplace to tie-down, tape down, or hold down.

Unfortunately, current solutions and methods are used inconsistently and can often be ineffective and difficult to implement. The Q Holder ends the practice of physically overpowering the child to gain control and render the child motionless. The Pediatric Position Holder is used in a highly monitored setting under the care of a certified health care provider and is removed immediately after the procedure. The holding time is limited in duration to support a specific position and is not considered restraint intervention by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Our positioner allows us to "hold without handling.” The methodology designed into The Q pediatric position holder places the child in a warm, cushioned and open design for medical procedures where the lines, tubes, and catheters are easily accessible. The Q is intended to compliment and not replace the child life specialist.

## The ergonomic features

The new contoured ergonomic design is a pure positioning innovation which:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Contours to the child's body rather than the child being forced to conform to the immobilizer.</li>
  <li>Reduces excessive motion.</li>
  <li>Minimizes pressure points on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Provides for clearance of tubes and lines.</li>
  <li>Firmly contours to support the head and neck as a unit.</li>
</ol>

| *Comfortable, relaxed patients allow technicians to capture better images* |

## Design

The design keeps the arms and legs away form the chest and abdomen leaving the chest "open" for better respirations.

## Radiation reduction

The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within pediatric radiology and is an exceptional benefit provided by The Q Holder.

The Q assists children to remain montionless for diagnostic X-Rays, thus fewer exposures could mean less radiation. The Q allows the radiologic technologists to remain further from the primary and scatter radiation.

## Parents are positive about The Q

![Mother & Child - Pediatric Position Holder & Immobilizer](/images/IMG_1970.jpg)

> “Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – the technician had to manually restrain my daughter during the procedure and it was very upsetting to watch. My baby hated it. I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technologist used The Q Pediatric Position Holder. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent. It made the procedure easier for everyone!”

~	Mom of 6 month old infant, Lubbock, TX
