- The Q Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new child friendly, single patient use holder which is effective, safe, simple and versatile.
- The Q Position Holder is an emerging medical technology for children that standardizes the process of securely holding the child for medical procedures.
- Our 1/2" thick, soft polyurethane foam holder has no extraneous straps, boards, or hook & loop attachments.
- Our hope is that we can lessen the anxiety, fear, and distress which are ways that children respond to medical procedures.<sup>[1]</sup>
- The Q Holder is used for short periods in highly monitored settings.
- No other position holder leaves the chest, abdomen and pelvis free for unrestricted respirations as well as uninterrupted tube and line placement.

## The Q positioner maximizes contact, minimizes movement allowing for sufficient stabilization without unnecessary hands-on

## Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS)

- Child Life Specialists focus on the psychosocial aspect of the child providing coping mechanisms for procedures.
- Coping skills minimize the adverse effects on the child and parent.
- The Q is intended to compliments the work of the CCLS.
- The CCLS can incorporate the Q as one of the "comfort kit" tools by using it for medical play.

## Design

- Designed with field-testing for maximum usability.
- Designed to be compatible with all major commercial imaging systems.
- Designed so as not to give the sensation of being confined.
- The design keeps the arms and legs away form the chest and abdomen leaving the chest "open" for better respirations.
- The contoured ergonomic design is a pure positioning innovation.
- Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities without over-handling.
- Contours to the child rather than forcing the child to fit the positioner.
- Minimizes pressure points with a ½ inch thick comfortable foam.
- Does not interferer with tubes, lines and catheters.
- The Q supports the head and neck as a unit.
- Can be warmed in a towel warmer prior to use.

## Most pediatric medical procedures are better performed when the child is motionless

## Radiation reduction<br>(Reduccion De La Radiacion)

The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within the pediatric radiology community. The Q assists children to remain montionless for diagnostic X-Rays, thus fewer exposures could mean less radiation. 

The Q allows the radiologic technologists to remain further from the primary and scatter radiation.

  <blockquote>“Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – technologists had to manually restrain my daughter during the procedure.Therefore, I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technologist used The Q. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent.”</blockquote>
