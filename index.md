# Introducing The Q
## A Pediatric Position Holder

### **Why we call it The Q**
### (Por Que Lo LLamomos La Q)

The Q Pediatric Position Holder was created by Dr. Frank Quattromani (a.k.a. “Dr. Q”), a board certified pediatric radiologist.

- The Q Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new child friendly, single patient use holder which is effective, safe, simple and versatile.
- The Q Position Holder is an emerging medical technology for children that standardizes the process of securely holding the child for medical procedures.
- Our 1/2" thick, soft polyurethane foam holder has no extraneous straps, boards, or hook & loop attachments.
- Our hope is that we can lessen the anxiety, fear, and distress which are ways that children respond to medical procedures.
- The Q Holder is used for short periods in highly monitored settings.
- No other position holder 	__**leaves the chest, abdomen and pelvis free for unrestricted respirations as well as uninterrupted tube and line placement**__.

## Most pediatric medical procedures are better performed when the child is motionless

## Radiation reduction<br>(Reduccion De La Radiacion)

The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within the pediatric radiology community. The Q assists with positioning for diagnostic X-Rays, thus fewer exposures could mean less radiation. 

The Q allows the radiologic technologists to remain further from the primary and scatter radiation.
