#<center>THE PEDIATRIC POSITION HOLDER</center>

### The **Pediatric Position Holder** is a simple, durable or one-time use design, versatile, one-piece radiolucent child medical positioning aid which holds secure all four extremities individually in an antimicrobial-infused soft foam wrap with no extraneous straps, boards, velcro, medical tape, bandages, clamps, pins or fabrics.

The **Pediatric Position Holder** is designed for children weighing up to approx. 25 lbs.

The Pediatric Position Holder is a revolutionary new
pediatric child friendly device which is effective, safe, simple and versatile. 

The Pediatric Position Holder standardizes the process of immobilization, offering 
consistency across all modes of care for the infant and child

Decreasing child movement helps to improve the radiologic image quality as well as providing 3 key benefits:

1. Reduced radiation to technologist's eyes, thyroid, and hands
2. Reduced radiation to the child
3. Reduced radiation to the child’s parent

## How does it work?
The Pediatric Position Holder keeps the arms and legs out away from the chest and abdomen so the
child’s neurovascular, cardiovascular and respirations can be easily monitored during the procedures. Respirations are not obstructed.

The Pediatric Position Holder utilizes friction so there are no belts or straps. The Pediatric Position Holder is made from one single piece of soft ½ inch thick polyester foam. The soft foam is gentler on the child’s extremities than the strong hands of the health care provider.
 
The versatile design represents pure positioning innovation to ensure that all tubes and lines are not disturbed during the procedures. The holder is radiolucent for medical imaging, holds the child still for fewer repeat examinations and can be applied and removed in seconds. The foam holder firmly supports the head and neck. The holder is intended to compliment (not replace) the practice of the Child Life Specialist (CCLS)
 
Additional benefits:
-	Recyclable                          
-	100% polyester
-	Latex-free
-	Rx only
-	Single patient use
-	Non-sterile
-	CT, MRI and ultrasound safe
-	Hypoallergenic
-	Reduces motion artifacts
-	Gender neutral
-	Proudly made in the USA

## What Parents are Saying about the Pediatric Position Holder
> “Months ago my baby had a VCUG the old way – the technician had to manually restrain her during the procedure and it was very upsetting to watch. My baby hated it. I was so apprehensive when we returned for our follow-up examination. This time the technician used the Pediatric Position Holder. It was so much better for my baby and much less stressful for me as a parent. It made the procedure easier for everyone!”
~	Mom of 6 month old infant, Lubbock, TX

## IMMOBILIZERS
Currently, there is no uniform standard agreement on how children should be temporarily held immobile for various medical procedures. Instead, there are a variety of solutions and methods for holding a child motionless during a medical procedure, including blankets, sheets, pillowcases, towels, medical tape, ace bandages, manual physical force and procedural sedation.

Unfortunately, these solutions and methods are used inconsistently and can often be ineffective and difficult to implement. The Pediatric Position Holder ends the practice of physically overpowering the child to gain control and render the child motionless. The Pediatric Position Holder is available by prescription only, used in a highly monitored setting under the care of a certified health care provider and is removed immediately after the procedure. The holding time is of limited duration to support a specific position and is not considered restraint intervention by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Manual restraint techniques and commercial immobilizer devices may be used to keep the pediatric patient motionless. There are two techniques of immobilization. The first immobilizes for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) procedures where the “static” device such as the “papoose” or “swaddle” are standard with no need to access and manipulate catheters or lines during imaging (x-ray pictures).

The second technique consists of immobilization of the child while still selectively exposing all necessary lines and catheters for interactive and simultaneous manipulation during imaging.

The methodology designed into the **Pediatric Position Holder** places children in a warm, cushioned and open device for radiologic procedures where the constant and continuous line, tube and catheter repositioning, and manipulation is easily accessible. “Open device” is intended to mean that the chest and abdomen or entire torso remains unrestrained allowing for better respiration. Examples of procedures where access to the perineum and pelvis of the child are required include the voiding cysto-urethrogram (bladder and kidney) studies and contrast colon studies.

The Pediatric Position Holder is a multifunctional solution to provide immobilization for the following procedures, including:

-	Lancing abscesses
-	Repairing lacerations
-	Starting intravenous lines
-	Maintaining a sterile field
-	Performing basic radiologic procedures
-	Performing ECGs, ultrasound and CT examinations
-	And more

## REDUCED RADIATION EXPOSURE
The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within pediatric radiology and is an exceptional benefit provided by the **Pediatric Position Holder** as it limits exposure by decreasing repeats as well as lessening the area of the body exposed. The Image Gently Alliance (associated with the Society for Pediatric Radiology) intends to raise awareness about methods to reduce radiation dose during pediatric imaging procedures.

The Alliance states:

> “Children require special attention when receiving care in the hospital environment. Medical imaging procedures can be lifesaving for children who are sick or injured, but children are more sensitive than adults to the radiation these procedures deliver.”

Child safety is paramount when immobilizing a patient for diagnostic procedures. Immobilization and restraint can also be traumatizing to both the child and parent.

The **Pediatric Position Holder** is a new paradigm in providing a safe, comfortable and non-threatening option to better cradle and soothe the patient as well as reducing stress for the non-parent support.
