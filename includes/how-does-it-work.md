## How does it work?

**The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder** is designed for children weighing up to approx. 30 lbs.

The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder (immobilizer) keeps the arms and legs out away from the chest and abdomen so the child’s neurovascular, cardiovascular and respirations can be easily monitored during the procedures.

The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder utilizes friction so there are no belts or straps. The soft foam is gentler on the child’s extremities than the strong hands of the health care providers. Strong hands of the health care provider has been known to cause bruises. <sup>[2]</sup>

The holder is intended to compliment and not replace the practice of the child life specialist.
