How can it reduce Radiation? The opportunity to reduce radiation exposure is a critical issue within pediatric radiology and is an exceptional benefit provided by The “Q” Pediatric Position Holder (immobilizer).

“Children require special attention when receiving care in the hospital environment. Medical imaging procedures can be lifesaving for children who are sick or injured, but children are more sensitive than adults to the radiation these procedures deliver.”

The “Q” Pediatric Position Holder (immobilizer) is a new paradigm in providing a safe, comfortable and non-threatening option to better cradle and soothe the patient as well as reducing stress on the parents. Perhaps this is the time to re-evaluate past practices and look for a better, safer and more child-friendly medical device.
