## Why this design?

Our positioner allows us to "hold without handling.” The methodology designed into **The "Q" Pediatric Position Holder** (immobilizer) places the child in a warm, cushioned and open device for medical procedures where the lines, tubes, and catheters are easily accessible. Our “Open device” is intended to allow the chest and abdomen or entire torso to remain unrestrained allowing for better respiration. Examples of procedures where access to the perineum and pelvis of the child are required include the voiding cysto-urethrogram studies and contrast colon studies.
