## What are the ergonomic features?
The new CONTOURED ERGONOMIC design is a pure POSITIONING INNOVATION which:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Reduces excessive force on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Contours to the child's body rather than the child being forced to conform to the immobilizer.</li>
  <li>Reduces excessive motion.</li>
  <li>Minimizes pressure points on the child's extremities.</li>
  <li>Provides for clearance of tubes and lines.</li>
  <li>Firmly contours to support the head and neck as a unit.</li>
</ol>
